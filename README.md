# Biometric College Attendance App

The Biometric College Attendance App is a software application designed to streamline and automate the process of tracking student attendance in college using face recognition technology.

## Features

- **Face Recognition:** Utilizes advanced face recognition algorithms to identify and verify students' presence in class.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Automatically records and maintains attendance data for each student.
- **Real-time Updates:** Provides real-time updates to instructors and administrators regarding attendance status.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive interface for both students and faculty members.
- **Data Security:** Ensures the security and confidentiality of student information through robust data encryption measures.

## How it Works

The app utilizes the following steps to track attendance:

1. **Face Enrollment:** Students' facial features are initially captured and stored securely in the system during enrollment.
2. **Attendance Marking:** During class, the app captures live images of students and matches them with the enrolled faces to mark attendance.
3. **Attendance Records:** Attendance records are generated and stored securely in a database for future reference.
